Mole is a social game application for groups of people.
<br><br>
A player may create a room and invite his friends to join. In each turn, one of the players selects a category from a huge pool, and each player, but one, gets a subject from the selected category.
The last player, who is secretly raffled as a mole, gets a unknown subject.

No one knows who the mole is, and the mle does not know the subject.
In each round there is a random category selector and a mole.
The round is about 8 mins, and every player asks another player a trivial question about the subject.
The player who answered will ask the next question, and so on.

The purpose of the question is to interrogate each other and find the mole. 
Be careful not to ask and answer clearly. In case the mole is found, he has a way out to win.
If he guesses the subject correctly, he wins.
