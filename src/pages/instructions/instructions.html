            A player may create a room and invite his friends to join by a unuiqe entry code. 
            In each round, one of the players selects a category from a huge pool, and each player, but one, gets a subject from the selected category.
            The last player, who is secretly raffled as a spy, gets a "spy" character instead of the subject which is given to the other players.

            No one knows who the spy is, and the spy does not know what the subject is.
            In each round there is a random category selector and a random spy.
            The round is about 8 mins, and every player asks another player a trivial question about the subject.
            The player who answered will ask the next question, and so on.

        <div class="speech-bubble">
            <p>
                The purpose of the question is to interrogate each other and find the spy. 
                Be careful not to ask and answer too clearly questions and answers. In case the spy is catched, he has a way out to win.
                If he guesses the subject correctly, he wins.
